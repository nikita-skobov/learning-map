prerequisites: # list the names one by one
 - addition
 - notation
 # if no prerequisites, prerequisites should be set to an empty
 # list like so:
 # prerequisites: []

  # will be ignored. you can use these keys for aliases
  # or other data that you do not want to be rendered.

  # and certainly not here

  # your objects can contain spaces in case you're into that sort of thing
