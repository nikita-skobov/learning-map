      The sample mean is simply the average of your sample.
      If you sample ${\small n}$ individuals, and measure a characteristic, the sample
      mean would be the summation of the characteristic values divided by ${\small n}$.
  - formula: \LARGE \bar{x} = \frac{\sum\limits_{\small i=1}^{\small n} x_i}{n}

      In other words, add up the value measured for each individual, and divide by
      the number of individuals.
