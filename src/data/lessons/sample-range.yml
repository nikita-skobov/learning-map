      Where mean, and median are measures of central tendency, the sample range
      is a measure of variability. It is simply the smallest value in a sample
      subtracted from the largest value, or:
  - formula: '\LARGE X_{max} - X_{min}'

      If our sample is: ${\\ \{10, 20, 15, 20, 30\} \\}$

      the largest value is 30, the smallest value is 10. Therefore the range is
      ${\\ 30 - 10 = 20}$
