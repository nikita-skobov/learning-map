      To put simply, variance measures how far a set of data from the sample is
      spread out from the sample mean.

      the \ expectation \ of \ the \ squared \ deviation \ of \ a \ random \
      variable \ from \ its \ mean

      It sounds complicated, but really it's quite simple. 'expectation of'
      basically means it is an average. Deviation from the mean is simply the
      difference of a single value from the average value. So the sample
      variance can be calculated by taking the difference of every data point in
      the sample from the sample mean, and then squaring those differences, and
      then dividing by the number of observations, ie: divide by${\ n}$.
      However, when we measure variance of a sample that is meant to estimate a
      population, we divide by ${\ n - 1}$. This is called Bessel's correction.
      The value ${\ n - 1}$ is called the degrees of freedom.
