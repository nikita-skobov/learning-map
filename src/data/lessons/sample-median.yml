      The sample median is the 'middle' value of your sample. If you arrange
      your sample data in increasing or decreasing order (it does not matter since
      we are looking for the middle number) the median is the value that is in
      the middle of the sorted list of values. In the case that there are
      2 middle values (ie: the number of sample observations is even), the median
      is calculated by taking the average of the two middle values.

      \Large \bar{x} = \begin{cases}
        x_{(n + 1)/2} &\text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
        \frac{1}{2} (x_{n/2} + x_{n / 2+1}) &\text{if } n \text{ is even}
      \end{cases}

      In other words, add up the value measured for each individual, and divide by
      the number of individuals. Here is an example where n is odd (n = 5)
  - formula: 'x_1 , x_2 , \textcolor{red}{x_3} , x_4 , x_5'

      Since n is odd, we take the ${\small [(n + 1)/2] }$th element of x. ${\small (5 + 1) / 2 = 3}$. so we
      take ${\small \color{red} x_3}$ as our median.

  - formula: 'x_1 , x_2 , \textcolor{red}{x_3} , \textcolor{blue}{x_4} , x_5, x_6'

      Since n is even, we take the average of the two middle terms. The left middle term
      is ${\small x_{n/2}}$. n = 6, so that is ${\small \color{red} x_3}$. The right middle term is
      ${\small x_{n/2 + 1}}$ which is ${\small \color{blue} x_4}$. We then add up the values for those two
      individuals, and divide by two (since there are two individuals).
