      The standard deviation is a measure of variability. A low standard
      deviation suggests that the sample data points tend to be closer to the
      mean. A high standard deviation suggests that the sample data are much
      more spread out.

      The sample standard deviation is denoted by the latin letter ${\large s}$.
      It can be calculated by
  - formula: '\Large s = \sqrt{s^2}'
  - text: 'Where ${\Large s^2}$ is the sample variance.'
