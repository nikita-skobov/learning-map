name: Population Mean
description: measure of central tendency in a population
prerequisites: # list the names one by one
 - addition
 - division
 - notation
 - averages
 # if no prerequisites, prerequisites should be set to an empty
 # list like so:
 # prerequisites: []

substitutions:
  # NOTE: the following substitutions are done by the PARSER.
  # this is not a feature of yaml.
  # allow substitutions of both text, and katex symbols
  # via the syntax: ${yoursubstitution}$
  t: # t is short for text
    popmean: The population mean
  # you dont have to use t for text substitutions, the following will also work:
  popmean: The population mean
  # but you DO have to use k. if you want the substitution to be rendered
  # as katex!
  k: # k is short for katex
    # katex is a special key. if the parser sees katex,
    # it will pre-render these elements and allow substitution
    # inside of text fields via the ${katex.mu}$ syntax
    mu: '\mu'
    N: 'N'
  # you can also do katex substitutions by simply making your substitution:
  # ${\mu}$
  # if the parser sees that the first character is a backslash, it will treat it as katex

this is a weird key:
  # any root keys that are not part of the spec
  # will be ignored. you can use these keys for aliases
  # or other data that you do not want to be rendered.

lesson:
  - text: >
      ${popmean}$ is the average value of a characteristic from some group.
      The group can be anything, not necessarily persons; eg: the group can be all the cars in a country.
      The key is that the population represents ALL individuals of that group.
      ${t.popmean}$ is noted by the greek letter ${\mu}$ (pronounced mew).

  - formula: *formula1
  - text: >
      where ${k.N}$ is the total number of individuals in the population
      and ${\scriptstyle \large x_i}$ is a single observation of an individual (ie: the value of the characteristic for individual ${\large i}$)
