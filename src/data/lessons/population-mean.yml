      The population mean is the average value of a characteristic from some group.
      The group can be anything, not necessarily persons; eg: the group can be all the cars in a country.
      The key is that the population represents ALL individuals of that group.
      The population mean is noted by the greek letter Î¼ (pronounced mew).

  - formula: *formula1

      'where N is the total number of individuals in the population
      and x is a single observation of an individual (ie: the value of the characteristic)
      and the summation sums from 1 to N (ie: summing across all the individuals in the population).'
